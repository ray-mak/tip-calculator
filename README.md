<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This is a solution to the <strong>[Tip calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor]</strong> (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX).</p>
<h2>The Challenge</h2>
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

<h1>My Process</h1>
<p>As always, I go over the layout for desktop and mobile. I then create the design for both platforms before moving on to Javascript. </p>

<h2>Built With</h2>
I build this calculator with

- HTML
- CSS flexbox and Grid
- Vanilla JS

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<p>I learned how to add eventListeners for to a set of buttons. This was done to select a preset tip amount or a custom amount. The code itself isn't overly complex, but I was able to figure out the logic behind the code. I also learned a little more about queryselectorAll and querySelector. I was somewhat familiar with them, but up til this point I was largely using getElementById.  </p>
